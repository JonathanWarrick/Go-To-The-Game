# Go To The Game!

Check out the live app: http://gotothegame.herokuapp.com/

Analyze real-time ticket pricing for your favorite team's upcoming home games while seeing the relative bang you get for your buck using the opponent's winning percentage.

Currently the app supports data for upcoming NFL games in the 2014 season, but will soon implement similar data for upcoming NHL and NBA games for the current seasons.

The intention of this project is to provide meaningful data analysis while gaining exposure to several APIs and libraries, including:
* SeatGeek API (http://platform.seatgeek.com/) 
* SportsData API (http://www.sportsdatallc.com/)
* Chartist.js (http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/)
